# Connecting with SCRF

The Smart Contract Research Forum (SCRF) is where academics, researchers, and industry leaders from all over the world come together to discuss research, solicit thoughtful peer review, and find new projects on which to collaborate.

## Forum

The [Forum](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/) is a place for discovering new research, discussing ideas, finding peers, discovering projects to work on, and leaving polite, well-cited comments and suggestions.

## Chat

Behind the scenes, SCRF uses our [chat](https://discord.gg/MVySuD9JHQ) to coordinate. Itâ€™s a place to ask questions, find out about grants and bounties, share news, and get to know the community.

Drop in, introduce yourself, and tell us what brings you to SCRF in our `#general` channel. As you progress from being a Community Member to a Contributor or a Core Team Member, make sure to ask about other channels.

## Meetings

The [Public Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_45nqubmu17kcm9r1p8o5sqtte0%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York) provides times and links to our weekly Community Calls and other recurring public meetings. Everyone is welcome to attend. 

Public meetings are a place for pitching project ideas, hearing news about SCRF, asking our leadership team questions, and for meeting newcomers. There may be other meetings to attend as you become involved with the various projects underway at SCRF.

## GitHub

We use GitHub for project management and as a repository for templates, grant applications, contributors guidelines and other important documents.

SCRF does all of its work out in the open. Issues, content and new projects are tracked in two locations:

- [Document Pipeline](https://github.com/orgs/smartcontractresearchforum/projects/5): for our peer-review and editing process.
- [Projects Board](https://github.com/orgs/smartcontractresearchforum/projects/4): for Research Improvement Proposals and general operations tasks.
